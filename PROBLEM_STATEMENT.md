# Problem Statement: Personal Carbon Footprint Tracker

## The Challenge
Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, driven largely by greenhouse gas emissions. While governments and corporations play a significant role, individual actions collectively act as a major contributor to global carbon footprints. However, most individuals lack the tools and knowledge to:
1. Accurately measure their daily carbon emissions.
2. Understand which specific activities (transportation, diet, energy usage) contribute most to their footprint.
3. Receive actionable, personalized advice on how to reduce their impact effectively.

Without visibility and guidance, specifically tailored to their lifestyle, it is difficult for people to make meaningful behavioral changes that benefit the environment.

## The Solution
The **Carbon Footprint Calculator & Tracker** is a scalable, full-stack web application designed to bridge this gap. It empowers users to take control of their environmental impact through an intuitive, data-driven platform.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Quantifiable Impact**: Users can log daily activities across multiple categories (Transportation, Home Energy, Diet) to see real-time calculations of their carbon emissions (in kg CO2e).
- **Visual Insights**: An interactive dashboard transforms raw data into understandable trends and charts, allowing users to track their progress over time.
- **AI-Driven Recommendations**: Beyond just tracking, the application leverages intelligent algorithms to analyze user data and provide personalized, high-impact tips for reducing emissions (e.g., "Switching to a plant-based meal twice a week could save you 15kg of CO2 this month").

## Impact & Goals
The goal of this project is to democratize sustainability. By making carbon tracking simple, engaging, and visually appealing, we aim to:
- **Educate** users about the hidden costs of daily choices.
- **Motivate** consistent improvement through gamification and progress tracking.
- **Reduce** the aggregate carbon footprint of our user base, contributing to global sustainability efforts.

This tool transforms abstract climate anxiety into concrete, manageable individual action.
